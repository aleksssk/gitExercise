First feature - Numx2:
<br />
multiples the number(x) by itself.
<br />
To test this feature, go to "numx2test.java" class and change the number in the test.NumX2() method. Then change the assertEquals method so that it has the square of your inputted number.
<br />
Currently the test is set to have "5" in test.NumX2() and "25" in assertEquals.
