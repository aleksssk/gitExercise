First feature - Numx2:
\n
multiples the number(x) by itself.
\n
To test this feature, go to "numx2test.java" class and change the number in the test.NumX2() method. Then change the assertEquals method so that it has the square of your inputted number.
\n
Currently the test is set to have "5" in test.NumX2() and "25" in assertEquals.
