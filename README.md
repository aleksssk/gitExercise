# Github Exercise
First feature - Numx2:
<br />
<br />
multiples the number(x) by itself.
<br />
<br />
To test this feature, go to "numx2test.java" class and change the number in the test.NumX2() method. Then change the assertEquals method so that it has the square of your inputted number.
<br />
<br />
Currently the test is set to have "5" in test.NumX2() and "25" in assertEquals.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Second feature - Numx3:
<br />
<br />
multiples the number(x) by itself two times (x*x*x).
<br />
<br />
To test this feature, go to "numx3test.java" class and change the number in the test.NumX3() method. Then change the assertEquals method so that it has the number multipled by itself two times(x*x*x) of your inputted number.
<br />
<br />
Currently the test is set to have "5" in test.NumX2() and "125" in assertEquals.
